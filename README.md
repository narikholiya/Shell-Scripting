🖥️Shell Scripting
A shell script is simply a text file containing commands that the shell (bash, sh, zsh, etc.) can read and execute.

✨ Why use shell scripts?

-Automate repetitive tasks (backups, deployments, housekeeping).

-Simplify complex command sequences.

-Schedule jobs via cron or other schedulers.

-Glue different tools together in a single workflow.
